# InnoVd Location Tracking System

A comprehensive architecture and documentation repository for building a world-class location tracking platform that handles real-time field force management at scale.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains detailed technical documentation for implementing a high-performance location tracking system designed to:
- Handle 1M+ location updates per minute
- Support 100K+ concurrent devices
- Provide real-time tracking with <100ms latency
- Scale globally with 99.99% uptime

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### Core Architecture
- **[Location Tracking Architecture](docs/location-tracking-architecture.md)** - Complete system design and current implementation analysis
- **[Go Microservice Blueprint](docs/location-tracking-go-microservice.md)** - Detailed Go implementation with ClickHouse integration
- **[GCP Infrastructure Blueprint](docs/location-tracking-gcp-infrastructure-blueprint.md)** - Production-ready Terraform configurations
- **[Migration Strategy](docs/location-tracking-migration-strategy.md)** - Zero-downtime migration from TypeScript/MQTT to Go/Pub/Sub

### Mobile & Frontend
- **[Mobile App Migration Guide](docs/mobile-app-migration.md)** - Flutter implementation for MQTT to Pub/Sub transition
- **[Dashboard Enhancement Plan](docs/dashboard-enhancements.md)** - World-class UI/UX improvements for real-time visualization

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go microservices with gRPC
- **Messaging**: Google Pub/Sub (migrating from MQTT)
- **Databases**: ClickHouse (time-series), PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (cache)
- **Infrastructure**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Mobile**: Flutter with dual publishing support

### Key Features
- Real-time location tracking with sub-second updates
- Advanced geofencing and route optimization
- Battery-optimized mobile tracking
- Predictive analytics and anomaly detection
- Multi-region deployment with automatic failover

## 🎯 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Location Updates | 1M+ per minute |
| API Latency | <100ms (p95) |
| Dashboard Updates | <1 second |
| Data Retention | 90 days hot, 1 year cold |
| System Uptime | 99.99% |

## 💰 Cost Optimization

The architecture includes comprehensive cost analysis for different scales:
- **10 devices**: ~$83/month
- **100 devices**: ~$216/month  
- **1000 devices**: ~$657/month

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive location data
- GDPR compliance with configurable retention policies
- Google Cloud security best practices
- Zero-trust architecture with defense in depth

## 🚦 Migration Approach

The system supports gradual migration with:
1. Dual publishing from mobile apps
2. Shadow mode for Go services
3. Progressive traffic splitting
4. Instant rollback capability

## 📖 Getting Started

1. Review the [Location Tracking Architecture](docs/location-tracking-architecture.md) for system overview
2. Check the [Migration Strategy](docs/location-tracking-migration-strategy.md) for implementation approach
3. Use the [GCP Infrastructure Blueprint](docs/location-tracking-gcp-infrastructure-blueprint.md) for deployment
